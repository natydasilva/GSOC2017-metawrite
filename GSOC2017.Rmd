## Bio of Student 

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Iowa State University (ISU) working with Dianne Cook and Heike Hofmann.
My Ph.D. project is about bagged projection methods for supervised classification in big data.
I have been working in R for a long time, and I have experience doing shiny 
([shiny_PPforest](https://natydasilva.shinyapps.io/Shinyppforest/), [shiny_mosquito](https://natydasilva.shinyapps.io/shiny_msq/) and [shiny_poverty](https://ndasilva.shinyapps.io/shiny-pov/) and R packages ([PPforest](https://github.com/natydasilva)). You can find some of my recent project on my github account ([My-Github](https://github.com/natydasilva)).

I have completed my M.S. in Statistics at Iowa State University working in network meta-analysis with Bayesian inference in Spring 2014. From my M.S. thesis I have published the paper "Mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) vaccines used in piglets" available in 
([paper-meta-analysis](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587714003444)).
I have worked in different meta-analysis projects as an RA at ISU, in my webpage you can find other publications I have in this topic ([My-webpage](http://ndasilva.public.iastate.edu/page.html))

I qualifies for this project because I have experience in R and in meta-analysis and I would like to work in this project as part of GSOC 2017.

## Coding Plan and Methods

### Introduction 

Systematic reviews are an approach used by public health agencies such as the World Health Organization to understand how treatments are effective and approach to disease control. Systematic reviews  in the literature often include a meta-analysis that summarizes the findings of multiple studies. It is critical that such reviews are updated rapidly as new scientific information becomes available, so the best evidence is used for the best advise. However, the current peer-reviewed journal based approach to publishing systemic reviews means that reviews can rapidly become out of date and updating is often delayed by the publication model. Living systematic reviews have been proposed as a new approach to dealing with this problem. The main concept of a living review is to enable rapid updating of systematic reviews as new research becomes available, while also ensuring a transparent process and reproducible review. 

**metawRite** package have the objective to simplify the review, write and update in a systematic review. This package will be an approach to do a living systematic review easily and available for all.
 The  goal is to combine in the package, the writing and analysis of the review that also enables versioning and updating. This package will allow an easy and effective way to display a living systematic review available in a web-based display. 

Three main tasks are needed to have an effective living systematic review; the ability to produce dynamic reports, availability online with an interface that enables end users to understand the data and the ability to efficiently update the review(and any meta-analyis) with new research seamless.

**metawRite** will cover these tree task integrated in a friendly web based environment for the final user. This package is not a new meta analysis package instead will be flexible enough to read different output models from the most used meta-analysis packages in R, organize the information and display the results in an user driven interactive dash board. The main function of this package will display a modern web-based application for update a living systematic review.
This package combines the power of R and shiny to get a dynamic reports and up to date meta-analysis results remaining user friendly. The package has the potential to be used by a large number of groups that conduct and update systematic review such as What Works clearing house (WWC) â€“ which reviews education interventions, Campbell Collaboration (cambell-collaboration) that includes reviews on topics such as social and criminal justice issues and many other social science topics, the Collaboration for Environment Evidence (environment-evidence) and food production and security (syreaf). 


### Details to complete the work

To complete this project I plan to split my work in three main components:

1. Data transformation and results computations.

 In this part I will write funcions to facilitate the data transformation and manipulation to run classic pairwise meta-analysis. 
 Two fit classic meta-analysis models I will use initially  **metafor** and **meta** packages.
 The idea is to make available functions to facilitate the analysis to the final user of our app. 
For example, * pairwise_metafor* will be a funtion to restructure data and run pairwise meta-analysis results using  **metafor** package. The model output will be saved in an .rda in list structure to be easily in the final shinyapp. 

```{r}
#' @usage pairwise_metafor(dataini, ...)
#' @param dataini Data frame in an arm-based format (e.g. input format for WinBUGS)
#' @param ... optional argument to functions, you can include any parameter to run rma 
#' function from metafor pkg
#' @return returns two .rda one with the data set in contrast-based format and the 
#' second .rda is a list with the pairwise meta-analysis for each update and each pair of treatments.
```


2. Writing dynamic reports

The ability to produce dynamic reports is a key characteristic of a living systematic review. 
To get reproducible and dynamic reports I will use **knitr** package. A second main task in LSR is to make the reports available online with an interface that enables end users to understand the data and the ability to efficiently update the review. I will use **shiny** combined with **knitr** to get this second functionality.
Here the challenge will be the persistent storage for the different versions. The storage can be local or remote and there are a lot of different approaches.  At initial stage I will design the package to get local persistent storage but I think maybe will be more apropriate to do a remote storage.
 
The final user will be able to write the report in a shiny app, the first *tabsetPanel* will contain a standardize report structure defined in the *ui* using *textAreaInput*. 
In this tabsetPanel the user will write the report using **knitr**, save it and be able to download the pdf file. After the first submission the user will be able to see the previous report versions and change it as they need it. To do this I will use **shinyjs** package. 


3. Visualization and summary information

 With the model results from pairwise meta-analysis or network meta analysis (if this is available) summary results will be presented. A second tabset containing the results 
 With the model information some interactive visualizations will be available using **ggplot2**, and **plotly** to get interactive graphs. All the visualization will be presented in a dashbard using **shiny**. 


The final user will get a web application using **shiny** with three modules or tabsets as a main result, 

-	Report: this first tablset will display an environment to make an interactive report using kntr. You will write your update report in the web application to be available online and the user can download the report in different formats as they need it. Also the previous reports will be available to be modified using the shiny interactive functionalities.

-	Pairwise meta-analysis: In this second tabset the main results from a pairwise meta-analysis will be displayed. The user can interact in the application to self discover the main results, selecting the update results and treatments to explore. Model fit and interactive plots will be available.

-	Network meta-analysis: If network meta analysis is needed this third tabset will be available. The main results from a network meta-analysis will be displayed. The user can interact in the application to self discover the main results, selecting the update results to explore. Model fit and interactive plots will be available.


<!-- Describe in detail your plan for completing the work.  What functions will be written, how and when will you do design, how will you verify the results of your coding?  The sub-section headings below are examples only.  Each project is different, please make your application appropriate to the work you propose.   -->

<!-- Describe perceived obstacles and challenges, and how you plan to overcome them. -->

<!-- The best R GSoC applications tend to be 10+ pages printed. Planning is a key part of a successful project, and demonstrates to the mentors that you are qualified and engaged. -->


## Timeline

<!-- (consult GSOC schedule) -->

<!-- Provide a detailed timeline of how you plan to spend your summer.  Don't leave testing and documentation for last, as that's almost a guarantee of a failed project.  -->

<!-- Make sure to identify what you plan to accomplish in each month of the project.  Google has asked organizations to be more directive about milestones. Also be sure to identify what you will accomplish between acceptance and the official start of coding. (Hint: establishing your build environment and researching existing work shouldn't wait till project start) -->

<!-- What is your contingency plan for things not going to schedule? We understand things change, but how are you planning to address changes and setbacks? -->

<!-- If you have other time commitments that will interfere with GSoC, we highly recommend explaining how you will front-load the work before coding start or work extra early on to build a cushion! -->
